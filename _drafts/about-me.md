Hello and welcome to my portfolio!

I'm Enrique Martínez, a computer science student at [42 Málaga](https://www.42malaga.com/), 
let me tell you a little bit about myself.

After completing my bachelor's degree in Business Management and Administration,
I spent three years working in Digital Marketing and SEO. However, I soon
discovered that programming was my true passion. I began learning Python two
years ago, and more recently, I have been programming in C, and I've also gained
experience in Git and Linux.

I'm always excited to learn new skills and techniques to improve my coding abilities, and I'm currently seeking an internship in the field of data science, machine learning, or software development.

Thank you for taking the time to learn a little bit about me. I hope you enjoy exploring my portfolio and seeing some of the projects I've been working on.
