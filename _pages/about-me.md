Hello and welcome to my blog!

I'm Enrique Martínez, a computer science student at [42 Málaga](https://www.42malaga.com/),
let me tell you a little bit about myself.

After completing my bachelor's degree in Business Management and
Administration, I worked for three years in Digital Marketing and SEO.

While being there, I found that a lot of the work I was doing was repetitive
and it could be optimized, so started learning Python and JavaScript while I
programmed little tools for our daily use. The tools included a Slack bot, a
lot of Google Sheets automations, web crawlers, scrapers...

I discovered that solving problems and helping my team doing things easier with
programming was my true passion.

In 2023, after 2 years learning Python by myself and dedicating almost all my
free time to learn programming and creating my own projects, I decided that I
would take a sabbatical year to continue studying and improving my skills in
order to find a programming job.

In august 2022, I tried the 42 School methodology by jumping into the 'Pool', a
26 days bootcamp in which we learned a lot about Git, Unix systems, C
programming, and what I found most useful and loved the most, working and
learning with your peers, as there are no teachers or classes.

A month later, they told me that I was selected for continuing my studies there
in the 'Cursus' (the 42 style equivalent to a Computer Science degree) and that's
what I am doing right now!

As of writing this (march 2023), I have finished 9 of the 16 projects that form
the 'Common Core' and I'm currently seeking for an open source project or
internship in the field of data science, machine learning, or software
development.

Thank you for taking the time to learn a little bit about me. I hope you enjoy
exploring my portfolio and seeing some of the projects I've been working on.
