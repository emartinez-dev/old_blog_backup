![Hello world program written by Brian Kernighan in
1978](/assets/images/Hello_World_Brian_Kernighan_1978.jpg)

I have been thinking about creating a developer blog and writing technical
articles for a long time, but I have always thought that I didn't know anything
or that my ideas were not worth sharing. After reflecting and examining my
thoughts, I realized that my thinking process holded me back and has been doing
it for quite some time.

But not anymore, here I am writing my first post on my blog, and hopefully many
to come!

## printf("Hello World!");

As the first line of code you write when trying a new programming language,
here is my blog 'Hello World'.

My aim with this blog is to write about my experiences and learned lessons while
programming, so I can help others facing similar problems or challenges as I do.

As a 42 School student, I think the best way to learn something is Peer
Learning, getting help from your peers and helping them. Unfortunately, I
can't be at school as much as I wanted and I think this is a good way to help
my peers and to contribute to the 42 Network.

I would also love to connect with others in the tech community and collaborate
on open source projects. All of this while improving my English and my
communication skills, since I don't have written too much on English since high
school and I feel a bit rusty.

**So, why I haven't done it before?**

## The fear of failure and how to overcome it

Everyone has their own vision and concept of what failure is, but for me it is
like falling down a bike, and the thought process is also the same. You do not
fear hitting the ground (as long as you were not going too fast and it doesn't
hurt physically), the thing you fear the most is if someone has seen you
falling.

Ok, you are scared of failing and looking stupid in front of other people. So what?
All of us are too busy not _falling from our own bike_ to make fun of you, you
are the only one going over it with a fine-tooth comb.

Failure can be difficult to handle, but it's also inevitable in some way. If you
are learning something or you are going through a new situation, it's totally
normal if you fail or you don't do it perfectly on the first try. There are a
lot of implicit benefits that come from failure:

- You just learned something. You can do better next time If you analyze what
	went wrong and why.
- Your resilence improves, and you learn how to carry on when things don't go
	the way we want them to.
- You build self-steem. If you failed, you probably faced your fears
	and went out of your comfort zone. Your effort is worth, and the final
	outcome is not the only thing that matters.
- You become more empathic, as you can relate to others with similar experiences.
	Also by sharing it, you can build stronger and deeper relationships, don't
	be scared of looking vulnerable, we all are.

The way of overcoming failure is about changing your mindset, you have to
reframe failure as an inevitable part of life, and see it as a learning
opportunity. This way, you will develop a growth mindset and be happier overall.

If you are interested in learning more about the growth mindset and want to
delve deeper into the subject, I recommend you a book written by Carol S. Dweck,
a psychology professor at Stanford University, called ['Mindset: The New
Psychology of
Success'](https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=APwXEdcK1-P0DMV1v0ejfTvYpAIWeun4Pw:1679917813067&si=AMnBZoG3cRyxvViEiVWeqgrn-CuWcnxp6_6_G7EH225wAKYHQoWMnatQiAo0vcw0MQQYiLz8EutZZSl9ndjCFC7IMK-QkSppudOvuoHoKgCUvdXYLGwiDUOOe_YGIcJC9yqynZFXv0vNHmtP9OqEhKHebm-OMh8PbncOdHnOnDllD4wmJFnEJfpmQl2_Ziu2vuLI8wOKsHVz8noR9tninCiikLgmND3BaAXk5Kyg05LlNnnKTjy5CX3V-nYOiSUw2Y6fqWFvrSPAFmJQtr3T_xEIzFHg5sVvdIjJv8R0CHhNs8ctCU_jEDyDfGhHaCzk4PJ_oIQbNiB2MnYpNUXCGxFmeDUvK70DSw%3D%3D&q=mindset+the+new+psychology+of+success&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjppf_Dhfz9AhU0kFwKHU5JACoQs9oBKAB6BAhQEAI&biw=958&bih=919&dpr=1#wptab=si:AMnBZoG3LdTOK9CLLaTEr5J1eNwTpkLw2JLlhIS-WjzLt9CWpvvCAxI09su8bje4y0XX6T6mPpJvHm0fTNcNLuQPuwuy9PrBKb21TchoUcu8As_bElOQYtzYuL_9Rv4ZIQur255ZQCi2TVvVyo6jGcBL0pVlAgzDYA%3D%3D).

## Conclusion

My goal with this post is to introduce myself, and also try to help and
encourage anyone that has ever felt like this, your voice matters too and you
sure have a lot to share with the world.

If you have come this far, I would love to hear from you too! Feel free to leave
a comment or to contact me.
